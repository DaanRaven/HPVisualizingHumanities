# HPVisualizingHumanities
My project folder for the Visualizing Humanities project on Network Visualization. 

In this project I created a visualization of the relations between the 
different Harry Potter characters from Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.

The relations are based on the amount of times the names of characters co-appear within the text (within a range of 15 words).

The files for the character lines were gathered using AntConc-queries. These lines were further processed in a relatively repetitive python script.
This script checks the co-appearence for each character and gives the amount of co-appearances as output. 

Using this script the csv file containing the edges was created. 

Gephi was used to create the visualization of the network.
